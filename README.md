 NCAA fh data scrape and analysis

this code and functions allows for the scraping and parsing of the NCAA Field Hockey data for season preceding 2023. It can retrive and parse all play by play data sets for every game in each season. It can be adapted for other divisions and years easily, it allows for potental analysis never done before in field hockey. It is a work in progress, further development and optimization is required, the next major step is mapping the 'true' roster player names to the play by play names, that would allow for substitution data being parsed and metrics such and points+- and other such advanced metrics being produced.
